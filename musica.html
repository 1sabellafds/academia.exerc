Hear Me Now (feat. Bruno Martini & Zeeba)
If you get to hear me now

I know you'll get stronger
When you get older, oh
Just don't shrug your shoulders
When you get older, oh

Things aren't easy
So just believe me now
If you don't keep it cool now
You'll never make a sound

All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now

If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now

Leave excuses aside
Speak out your mind now
And don't let it slide
You're not always right, no

And things aren't easy
So just believe me now
Don't learn the hard way
Just let me show you how

All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now

If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now

If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
</p>

    Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

But now it's all good, babe
Roll that back wood, babe
And play me close

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

I spent last night on the last flight to you
Took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
We spent the daylight tryna make things right between us

But now it's all good, babe
Roll that back wood, babe
And play me close

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Maybe it's 6: 45
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars
No, it's really rude if I let you meet my mama
You don't want a girl like me I'm too crazy
For every other girl you meet its fugazy
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart
(let's get it though)
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more of a white Porsches and karats
I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play with your guitar

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
